AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source framework that allows developers to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go. It enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by generating AWS CloudFormation templates from high-level constructs, making deployment and management of cloud resources more efficient.
